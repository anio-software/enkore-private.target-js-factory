# üçÄ @fourtune/realm-js

This realm is used for fourtune TypeScript projects.

> [!WARNING]  
> üöß This project is still heavily under construction and not ready for any real serious project.

# Realm options

```ts
options: {
	external_npm_packages: [],
	runtime: "node" | "browser" | "agnostic"
}
```

|Option|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`external_npm_packages`|Mark packages that should not be bundled.|
|`runtime`|Tell fourtune what the intended runtime is. This will have an effect on how the `package.json` is evaluated and what the TypeScript settings will be.|

# Folder Structure

```
assets/
src/
    export/
          [module_name]/
                        <export_name>
           <export_name>
```

`src/export` is a special location where every file represents a **named** export.

For example `src/export/MyFunction.mts` would result in a named export `MyFunction` in the default module.

Exports can be grouped into "modules" to generate a bundle for each module:

`src/export/<module_name>/<export_name>`

> [!TIP]
> Modules can be nested as well.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are three export names that have a special meaning:
> 
> - `__star_export.mts` means export every named export from that file.
> 
> - `__default.mts` use the default export as the default export of the bundle.
> 
> - `__index.mts` is a combination of the above (i.e. default + all named exports).
> 
> It's best to avoid export names that start with an underscore.

# Async/Sync Variant Files

Async/Sync variant files are special files that contain the asynchronous as well as the synchronous implementation of an API/function in a single file.

Those files must start with two underscores `__`, contain `XXX` exactly once, and end with either `.as.mts` or `.as.d.mts`.

The `XXX` is expanded to nothing for the async version and expanded to `Sync` for the synchronous version.

For example `__myFunctionXXX.as.mts` would create two files called `myFunction.mts` and `myFunctionSync.mts`.

> ![NOTE]
> The underscores are there to discourage users from directly importing async/sync variant files.

When you define an async/sync variant fourtune will automatically create two new files based on your source file (one for the async version and one for the sync version).

These will be available at `#~synthetic/async.sync/<file-path>`.

# APIs

The realm exposes three main APIs that are all versioned under the same number. These APIs work dynamically (i.e. by just executing the project's code) as well as when bundling. Special measures are taken so that the resulting bundle size is optimized.

## üîå Runtime API

The runtime API provides a way of handling logging.

```ts
import {createContext} from "@fourtune/realm-js/v0/runtime"

//
// createContext creates a wrapped context instance
// which then can be passed to libraries supporting
// the fourtune runtime API.
//
const wrapped_context = createContext({
    // example where the created context would log 
    // all messages regardless of log level
    shouldLog() {
        return true
    }
})

// ----- a package using the fourtune runtime api will do something like this internally: ----- 
import {useContext} from "@fourtune/realm-js/runtime"
//                                           ^ not versioned because
//                                             useContext is designed to work
//                                             with any API version

//
// useContext asserts that the wrapped_context
// is of the specified version
//
const context = useContext(wrapped_context, 0)

// package actually using the context
context.log.info("Hello from the package")
```

The following options can be set to modify the behaviour of the created context:

|Name|Signature|Description
|:---|:---|:---|
|tag|`string`|A string that identifies the context.|
|shouldLog|`(ctx, level, pkg, tag): boolean`|Determine whether to log a message or not.|
|logWithLevel|`(ctx, level, lines): void`|Log a message with a specified level.|
|getCurrentLogLevel|`(ctx): LogLevel`|Get the current log level. (possibly from the environment)|
|printLine|`(ctx, line): void`|Print a line.|

---

### Log Levels

Log levels are represented not by a number but by a string:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`emerg` (to be implemented)|Unrecoverable error.|
|`error`||
|`warn`||
|`info`||
|`debug`|Used exclusively for debugging.|
|`trace`|Used exclusively for in-depth debugging.|

	
## üì¶ Assets API

The asset API provides a simple way to embed static resources in the resulting product.

Assets must be located inside the `/assets/` folder and can be of any type.

Every asset can be loaded through a different protocol yielding different representations of the same asset:

```ts
getAsset("protocol://path/to/asset")
```

For example, a TypeScript asset can be bundled up before being embedded into the product or accessed in its raw form with `text://`:

```ts
import {getAsset} from "@fourtune/realm-js/v0/assets"

// result: bundled javascript code
getAsset("js-bundle://test.mts")

// result: source code of "test.mts" as is
getAsset("text://test.mts")
```

> [!WARNING]  
> It's advised to only ever pass string literals to `getAsset` in order for the bundle optimization to properly work.
> 
> If a dynamic variable is passed, **every** asset going through **every** protocol will be embedded into the product. 

---

### Supported Protocols

|Protocol|Description|Required file type|
|:---|:---|---:|
|`text://`|Return the file contents as a string.|any|
|`js-bundle://`|Strip TypeScript types and bundle the JavaScript code.|Only .mts files.|

## üìú Project API

This API simply provides information about the project, such as the contents of the project's `package.json` and `fourtune.config.mjs`.

```ts
import {getProjectPackageJSON} from "@fourtune/realm-js/v0/project"

console.log(
    getProjectPackageJSON().version
)
```

## üñ®Ô∏è Autogenerate API

This API is exclusively used in the **build** process.

```ts
import {generateFactoryFiles} from "@fourtune/realm-js/v0/autogenerate"
```
